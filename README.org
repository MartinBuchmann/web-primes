* A simple Common Lisp web application factorizing numbers into primes

Just for my own pleasure and curiosity I wanted to combine Lisp's possibilities
to generate /dynamic/ [[http://www.cliki.net/Web][web]] pages and some basic math I picked up at [[https://projecteuler.net][Project
Euler]].  The whole endeavour was inspired by Adam Tornhill's great [[https://leanpub.com/lispweb][tutorial]].

I am using:

- [[http://weitz.de/hunchentoot/][hunchentoot]]
- [[http://weitz.de/cl-who/][cl-who]]
- [[https://common-lisp.net/project/parenscript/][parenscript]]

as the basic libraries which are all available via [[https://www.quicklisp.org/beta/][quicklisp]].
