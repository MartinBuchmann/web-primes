* A simple Common Lisp web application factorizing numbers into primes

Just for my own pleasure and curiosity I wanted to combine Lisp's possibilities
to generate /dynamic/ [[http://www.cliki.net/Web][web]] pages and some basic math I picked up at [[https://projecteuler.net][Project
Euler]].  The whole endeavour was inspired by Adam Tornhill's great [[https://leanpub.com/lispweb][tutorial]].

I am using:

- [[http://weitz.de/hunchentoot/][hunchentoot]]
- [[http://weitz.de/cl-who/][cl-who]]
- [[https://common-lisp.net/project/parenscript/][parenscript]]
- [[http://www.cliki.net/LASS][lass]]

as the basic libraries which are all available via [[https://www.quicklisp.org/beta/][quicklisp]].

I did not spend much time on the design of this page and have only very little
knowledge about JavaScript and CSS. This could all be added in a real web
application. Furthermore, one could set up a database and store factorizations
already calculated and so on...

** Loading the app

After downloading the source and place it in a location [[https://common-lisp.net/project/asdf/][ASDF]] knows, simply type:

#+BEGIN_SRC lisp
> (asdf:load-system :web-primes)
#+END_SRC

Then visit http://localhost:8080/primfaktoren in your browser and start factorizing.

To stop the server, type the following in your REPL:
#+BEGIN_SRC lisp
> (hunchentoot:stop web-primes::*acceptor*)
#+END_SRC

#  LocalWords:  REPL
